Yesterday Comes After
A project by Kc Weaver

This game attempts to display how one can use state to change an environment. To highlight the power of video game trickery to manipulate an experience,
this game takes place in a liminal space with an infinite time loop. There is no end but two different versions of the room to cycle through.

I used Twine to build my project as it was the simplest way to display two different states of one idea.

To play, simply download the file and open it through your browser.

To switch between nodes, simply click.

I learned to more clearly lay out what I want to do ahead of time more than anything. I think twine has more I could do that I got stuck on without using more advanced techniques.

If I had more time for the project, I would choose parts of the room's state to change based on variables.
